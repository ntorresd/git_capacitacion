## Introduction

Countries around the world are responding to an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, COVID-19. In this report we explore how the trajectory of the cumulative deaths of a number of countries.

The data come from the **coronavirus** [package](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus), which pulls data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository.

## Methods

We are using *ggplot2* and *readr*

## Data prep

Lets read the data of the following countries:

-   "China",
-   "France",
-   "United Kingdom",
-   "Turkey"

```{r}
country_data <- readr::read_csv("covid-country_data-drop_UnitedStates.csv")
```

## Visualisation

The following visualisation shows the number of cumulative cases vs. days elapsed since the 10th confirmed death in each country. The time span plotted for each country varies since some countries started seeing (and reporting) deaths from COVID-19 much later than others.

```{r}
#| label: visualise
#| warning: false

ggplot(data = country_data,
       mapping = aes(x = days_elapsed, 
                     y = cumulative_cases, 
                     color = country)) +
  # represent cumulative cases with lines
  geom_line() +
  # use pretty colors
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  # better formatting for y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  # customize labels
  labs(
    x = "Days since 10th confirmed death",
    y = "Cumulative number of deaths",
    title = "Cumulative deaths from COVID-19, selected countries",
    subtitle = "Data as of Sat, Dec 3, 2022",
    caption = "Source: github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus"
  )
```
